What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?

**I think the most interesting topic is predicting the future climate with different models.**

Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.

**I would like to try other models to predict the future climate and do more comparisons.**

What is a potential change youâ€™d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?

**I think I would choose to do some linear models if I have time. Also, I would like to try more hyperparameters for the random forest models.**

What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?

**The technique that I am interested in is applying xarray on datasets and plotting the variables with different projections on earth.**
